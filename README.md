## What
A modern, open source, hybrid vector/raster digital design application, built for all 3 major platforms.

## Why
This exists mainly because there isn't a lot of choice for a modern design and image editing software on Linux. Most Linux workflows have to route through multiple application level workflows. 

With Lucent Designer, we want to hybridize this into a workflow that can work well for a UI design workflow, or Print workflow, and maybe some raster image editing inbetween. 

A lot of inspiration for the software comes from Affinity Designer, which notoriously refuses target the Linux market, and is very difficult to get running on Linux. 

## The Experiment
We are taking a Linux first development approach by using QT to build for that platform first, while still compiling for Mac and Windows.

I'd like to see how far we can take developing in mainly QT to get us to a usable application with a solid user experience. While this may not get to competing with professional packages, I'd also like to support the workflows and exports to the Maker community. Possibly support not just designers, but an export engine that could enable laser cutting, board game design, even sewing. Ideally it's a "make a thing and export it to use in something physical"

Additionaly I want to see well I can push AI assisted coding techniques. Can we build in guardrails and agile principles to the process, in order to get stable, usable software out the other side? 

What does this look like in the open source model of open contribution, and how can we accept useful contributions, while minimizing AI rearchitecting, bloated code commits, bad patterns, and lots of churn/overwriting?

## Contributing
Please check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/lallmon/lucent-designer?tab=contributing-ov-file#readme) to see to contribute code, but in reality the best thing you can do is download it, use it and contribute feedback. Anything is appreciated, but especially bug reports and general UX issues.
