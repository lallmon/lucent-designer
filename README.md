## What
A modern, open source hybrid vector/raster digital design application, built with QT for all 3 major platforms.

## Why
This exists mainly because there isn't a good alternative to Affinity Designer on Linux, and with it's recent purchase by Canva and the quick enshittification of Affinity, it's pushed me to at least take a stab at some sort of alternative.

## The Experiment
Additionaly I want to see how far I can push current AI assisted coding techniques. 

Can I build in guardrails and agile principles to the process, in order to get stable, usable software out the other side? 

What would that look like in the open source model of open contribution, and how can we accept useful contributions, while minimizing AI slop generation, bloated code, and lots of churn/overwriting?
