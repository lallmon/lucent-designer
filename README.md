# DesignVibe

## What
A modern, open source hybrid vector/raster digital design application, built with QT. Taking a Linux first approach, but planning to be multi-platform.

## Why
Mainly because there isn't a good alternative to Affinity Designer on Linux honestly, and with their purchase by Canva and the quick enshittification of that software, it's pushed me to at least take a stab at something.

# Architecture 

I am currently learing both QTQuick and Python, so we don't have a solid architecture yet, but am open to suggestions and best practices.

## Contributing
There's plenty to do but the end goal is pretty clear for me, so if you want to help out, I'd love it anything I can do.

### Getting Started

As of right now you can follow [QT for Python](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/gettingstarted.html) guide to get going that way, but it might just be easier to grab [QT Creator](https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qtcreator/) which should have the python dependencies already in it.

#### AI Contributions
I have used AI on this project, so I am not against it, but you definitely need to wrangle that slop machine. LOL. Just straight vibe coding is definitely not something that will work in the long run.
